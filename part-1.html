            <h1>College of Engineering and Computing - Computer Science Department</h1>
            <h2 id="about">About the Department</h2>
            <p>Mason offers 132 degree programs at the masterâ€™s, doctoral, and professional levels, as well as more than 100 graduate-level certificates. Many classes are offered at times and locations that allow you to continue to work while pursuing your degree. George Mason provides classes in multiple places, with regional campuses in Fairfax, Arlington, and Prince William counties, an international branch campus in Songdo, South Korea, and instructional sites in Herndon, Lorton, Woodbridge, and Front Royal. Each George Mason campus plays a critical role in the economy and community of its surrounding region. At each campus, students and faculty have access to all the university's resources, while the duplication of programs and support services is minimized through the use of technology.The field of computing refers to a variety of processes grounded in computational thinking. 
                These processes include designing and constructing software systems to process information, to create communications and entertainment, and to identify information relevant to a particular purpose or problem. The emergence of new computing industries, the increased reliance on computation in all parts of society, and the demand for computing throughout a worldwide economy reflect computing's broad applications. 
                As the field of computing has evolved, jobs in many fields now focus on the use of software.The Computer Science graduate program prepares students for research and professional practice in computer science and related technologies. 
                The program includes both fundamentals and advanced work in the areas of artificial intelligence and databases, programming languages and software engineering, systems and networks, 
                theoretical computer science, and visual computing. Graduate classes are divided into basic classes, which have no graduate course prerequisite, and advanced classes, 
                which have a graduate class as a prerequisite. Graduate classes are generally offered in the late afternoon and evening. 
                Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full-time degree-seeking students.The Computer Science Department at George Mason University offers a diverse range of programs designed to provide students with the 
                knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in the tech industry. The department focuses on research, innovation, and preparing students 
                for the challenges of the modern digital world. With strong ties to local 
                industry and a commitment to academic excellence, the department is a leader in computer science education.</p>
